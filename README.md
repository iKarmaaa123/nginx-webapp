<h1>Terraform Nginx DevOps Project</h1>
<p> This project involves installing an nginx web application onto an ec2 instance. The instance is part of a cloud inftrastructure that consists of a VPC with 2 subnets situated in 2 different
availaility zones. The project involved working with 3 environments: development, which is where I designed and debugged the code; staging, which is where I tested the code to ensure that the quality comes under a production-like environment before application deployment; production, this is environement where the final build of the code goes.</p>
